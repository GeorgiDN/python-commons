# IMAGE VIEWER

This Python script uses the Tkinter library to create a simple image viewer with forward and backward navigation buttons. 
The GUI window displays a series of images, and users can navigate through them using '<<' (back) and '>>' (forward) buttons. 
The program is equipped with an exit button to close the application. Additionally, the icons for the window and buttons are customized using images. 
This image viewer offers to explore a sequence of images in a slideshow fashion.
