# CREATE LOGO AND RESIZE AND OPEN IMAGES

This Python script utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to perform various operations on an image.
Firstly, it creates a logo icon by opening an image (for example - 'Python_logo.png') and saving it in the ICO format, commonly used for icons. 
Next, the script resizes another image (for example - 'Python_logo.png') to dimensions (for example - 300x300) pixels and saves the resized version.
Finally, the script opens the original image ('Python_logo.png') and displays it.
