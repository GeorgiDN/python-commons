# Batch Logo Overlay Script

This Python script applies a transparent logo to all images in a folder. 
It resizes the logo to be a percentage of the background image's width, 
ensuring it looks proportional across different image sizes. 
The logo is placed at the bottom-right corner of each image, with customizable transparency. 
The processed images are saved in an output folder, with consistent DPI for uniform display. 
This is useful for quickly branding multiple images with a logo in one go.
